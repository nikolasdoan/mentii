## Simple PRD — Web-only Minimal Demo (Looks Real, Doesn’t Need to Work)

### 1) Overview

**Product:** Mentor↔Mentee “Swipe + Compare + Unlock Contact” demo web app
**Goal:** Make it *feel* like a real marketplace so you can demo the concept and user flow.
**Non-goal:** No real matching, chat, booking, or payment processing required.

---

## 2) Demo scope (what the demo must show)

### Core user story (mentee)

1. Mentee lands on site
2. Searches “guitar”
3. Sees **10–15 mentors** in a list with filters + “Compare”
4. Clicks a mentor to view profile (contact info blurred)
5. Clicks **“Request Mentor”** (shows “Request sent”)
6. Clicks **“Unlock Contact”** (shows checkout UI → success)
7. Contact becomes visible (“Unlocked” badge)
8. Clicks **“Chat”** (opens a chat UI with fake messages)
9. Clicks **“Book Session”** (opens booking UI → confirm)

### Core user story (mentor)

1. Mentor switches to “Mentor Mode”
2. Creates/edits mentor profile (tags, price, availability, credentials)
3. Views “Requests Inbox” (shows fake pending requests)
4. Clicks Approve/Reject (UI updates state)

---

## 3) Pages / Screens (minimum set)

1. **Landing page**

   * CTA: “Find a mentor” / “Become a mentor”
2. **Auth (fake)**

   * “Continue with Email/Google” → always succeeds
3. **Search + Results**

   * Search bar + filters (topic, language, price, availability)
   * Mentor cards (price, rating, tags, “new” badge)
   * “Compare” panel (shows selected mentors side-by-side)
4. **Mentor Profile**

   * Full profile + pricing
   * Contact section blurred + “Unlock Contact” button
   * Buttons: “Request Mentor”, “Chat”, “Book”
5. **Checkout modal (fake payment)**

   * Package options: “Unlock 1”, “Unlock 3”
   * Button: “Pay” → success animation
6. **Chat UI**

   * Pre-filled conversation
   * Send button appends message locally
7. **Booking UI**

   * Calendar/time slots (static)
   * Confirm → “Booking confirmed” toast
8. **Mentor Dashboard**

   * Profile editor form
   * Requests inbox list with Approve/Reject buttons
9. **Admin (optional for demo)**

   * Toggle “Verified” badge on mentors

---

## 4) Fake data requirements (seeded JSON)

Create a local dataset of **30 mentors** including:

* name, avatar, headline
* tags (e.g., Guitar, Piano, Math, SAT)
* languages, timezone
* price range (e.g., $15–$80/hr)
* rating + review count
* response rate (for badges)
* credentials list (LinkedIn, School, test score) *display only*
* contact info fields (email/Line/WhatsApp) stored but **hidden until unlocked**

Also create **5 mentee profiles** (for demo switching).

---

## 5) Interactions (must “feel” real)

### Search & filters

* Filters update the list instantly (client-side filtering).
* “Sort by price/rating/new” changes ordering.

### Request flow

* Clicking “Request Mentor” changes button state to “Requested ✅”
* Mentor dashboard shows a new request (fake routing)

### Unlock contact (freemium)

* Contact info is blurred by default.
* Clicking “Unlock Contact” opens checkout.
* On “Pay” success: reveal contact info + show “Unlocked” badge.

### Chat

* Show a realistic thread (3–6 messages).
* Sending message appends to UI only.

### Booking

* Show 6–10 available time slots.
* Confirm shows success state + adds a “Upcoming session” card.

### Daily swipe/request limit (optional)

* Display “Requests left today: 3/5” and decrement locally.

---

## 6) Acceptance criteria (demo-ready)

The demo is considered done if:

* A new visitor can complete the mentee story in **under 2 minutes**
* All key buttons produce a convincing UI response (loading, success, state change)
* Contact paywall visually works (blur → reveal)
* Mentor dashboard shows requests and can “approve” them (even locally)

---

## 7) Tech notes (keep it lightweight)

* **Web-only**, single-page app is fine.
* Recommended: Next.js or plain React.
* Use local state + seeded JSON (no backend required).
* Optional: persist to localStorage so refresh keeps “unlocked” and “requested” states.

---

## 8) Out of scope (explicit)

* Real authentication
* Real payments
* Real chat infrastructure
* Real booking + calendar sync
* Real verification/KYC (UI only)

---

If you want, tell me which frontend stack you’re using (Next.js / React / Vue) and I can produce a **one-file route map + component list** that your dev can build in a day (still demo-only, no backend).
